				<h1>Quality Education</h1>
				<p>
					Since 2000, there has been enormous progress in achieving the target of
					universal primary education. The total enrolment rate in developing regions
					reached 91 percent in 2015, and the worldwide number of children out of school
					has dropped by almost half. There has also been a dramatic increase in literacy
					rates, and many more girls are in school than ever before. These are all
					remarkable successes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Progress has also been tough in some developing regions due to high levels of
					poverty, armed conflicts and other emergencies. In Western Asia and North
					Africa, ongoing armed conflict has seen an increase in the number of children
					out of school. This is a worrying trend. While Sub-Saharan Africa made the
					greatest progress in primary school enrolment among all developing regions –
					from 52 percent in 1990, up to 78 percent in 2012 – large disparities still
					remain. Children from the poorest households are up to four times more likely to
					be out of school than those of the richest households. Disparities between rural
					and urban areas also remain high.
				</p>
				<p>
					Achieving inclusive and quality education for all reaffirms the belief that
					education is one of the most powerful and proven vehicles for sustainable
					development. This goal ensures that all girls and boys complete free primary and
					secondary schooling by 2030. It also aims to provide equal access to affordable
					vocational training, to eliminate gender and wealth disparities, and achieve
					universal access to a quality higher education.
